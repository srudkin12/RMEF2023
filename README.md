# RMEF2023
Code and materials to accompany "What is TDABM?" 

An annotated example is provided to help you get started using TDABM. The file is called Application of TDABM.docx takes you through an analysis of some census 2011 data. 

The data file used in the example is rmef2023.csv

There are two code files:
The file Code for What is TDABM.txt has codes to create all of the material. 
The file Exercise Solutions.txt has solutions to the exercises in the commentary file.

To get started, create a folder to act as a working directory. Save the data file and code files into your folder. Follow the instructions in the files to generate the output in R. Because the session is only short, there will not be time to go through this content in the RMEF session. I am happy to answer questions by email simon.rudkin@manchester.ac.uk
